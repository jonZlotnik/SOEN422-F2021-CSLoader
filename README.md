# SOEN422-F2021-CSLoader
Instructions and useful files for the CSLoader

## Prerequisites
- Install the [.NET SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download) for your platform.
- Ensure `dotnet` is in your PATH environment variable.
- Check `dotnet` version is above 5.0

  ```bash
  dotnet --version
  ```

Note: Running in a [docker container won't work](https://github.com/docker/for-win/issues/1018) because you need access to your computer's serial interface.

## Building/running the loader

From root of this repo:

```bash
dotnet run
```
